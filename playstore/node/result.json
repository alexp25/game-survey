Great at passing time, however, there are a couple problems. Sometimes I get kicked out for hacking, even though I'm not nearly tech savvy enough to hack, and it often kicks me out of a game for other various reasons, the most frequent being \"you are running an old version of the game\" or similar. But I can't or don't need to update. It's frustrating but if that gets fixed the game gets a 5 star rating from me!","I think this is amazing!! Really love it!! My problem is when in free play if you the imposter vent in front of a teammate they will act clueless! To me it doesn't make sense. Also, to those who are saying that it always says it's full even though it's not u took it as a lot of people also joined so now there's no more room. Hope this helps!! In conclusion, I think free play should be upgraded a lot. And the full player symbol is just enough people joining. Have a awesome day!! üòÅ","Extremely fun and an overall great experience but i have some issues. When you want to play publiclly you cant. The rooms are always full and you can barely play. Also, if you leave a game too many times you can't join any other game for 5 or 10 minutes. This really annoys me because you can run into some really toxic players, or get in to a game that has setting you hate. I love this game but would really appreaciate if you change or just tweak those a little bit. Overall great game though. üòÅ","It's a very good game and entertaining. But there are a lot of bugs and glitches. For example : if i try to join a public server like with 3 peopls sometimes it says \"the server is full.\" I dont know why and it always happens when I try to join a server like 9-6 peoples and also says the same thing. I understand that people might started the game already but ALWAYS!? It didn't happened when i just installed the game..and also other glitches. Please fix these problems..","The game is good and all. But ever since the last update, I've getting trouble staying in the game after a round is finished. I tried both the beta and public version and the game somehow is still shutting down after a game is finished. Maybe it's compatibility issue with my pixel 3a? Since I don't see anyone talking about this. But overall the game is fun and interesting, if you are into solving mystery and stuff. Random lobbies...meh, you would get frustrated."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.innersloth.spacemafia","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.innersloth.spacemafia&hl=en&gl=us"}]
