                "I've read about a lot of people having issues with signing up or creating an account. I was fortunate enough to not have those issues. There was a 2 step verification for creating accts (to discourage bots and fake accts I assume), and I was able to do this without issues. App itself is a bit laggy at times, but I chalk this up to growing pains, and am confident the dev team will resolve this. As a platform, a great alternative to Twitter. No fact checking, no censorship.",
                "I was on Parler through my laptop and downloaded the app so I could use it mobile. It worked perfectly on Android. You have to be ready with email and pw. Then, I had to do the captcha and put in the code they sent me. The second time I signed in I got interrupted by a phone call I had to decline and I mistyped the security code. There was plenty of time to delete it and retype correctly. No problems at all. Thank you Parler that we can now speak freely.",
                "I didn't have any problems signing up or accessing the app and it seems pretty easy to find and follow people. It gets 4 stars from me because, in order to send a message to someone, you have to be verified. And, in order to be verified, you have to send them a picture of the front/back of your license and a selfie. The selfie part i have no problem with. However, there's no need to have my license information.",
                "Terrible. I went to create an account and it forced me to give my phone number. An authentication code was supposed to be sent to my email and it never showed up. You can't just press a button to resend the authentication code on the app. You must wait 60 seconds before you can resend. I did and the code STILL didn't show up. Yes I'm sure the email was correctly entered and yes I checked my spam folder. I can tell it's not worth using even before getting past the front gate.",
                "I created account and went into Parler several times. Then I didn't for a like a week and it froze on me - it would not load and said something like inactive account. I deleted app and reinstalled and now I cannot remember my password. When I tap forgot password for them to send me an email to reset it, I never receive the email. There is no option to receive a text instead so now I cannot get back on. I cannot even create different account. This is only place I found maybe someone can help"

                "This app and website is poorly designed. Sometimes it won't even fit on my phone. It's hard to find \"continue to read\" links. The ads are always getting in the way. It's extremely difficult to find anything. It's like they put all the content in a blender and pull-out whatever they grabbed first and paste it on the site. I've see teenagers build a better website and apps then Newsmax. I love the content but hate this app and their website. When you fix it, I'll be back.",
                "Great news app from a reliable news source. Not polluted by a bunch of so-called \"pundits\" telling you what to think about what happened. Instead they just tell you what happened (aka the news). App is fairly straightforward & easy to use. Find many prior segments from different news hour shows or watch live. Works great on my device (good performance, no buggy behavior so far).",
                "I have seen reviews of people having problems with live shows but I've been using the app and I have to say that I haven't had any issues with the app I will also note that I am using a galaxy note20 ultra 5g phone, now I don't know if that makes a difference but I'm very please to say that I'm very happy to see a real fair news outlet that I can go to for my daily news, thank you newsmax.",
                "Awesome idea, bad execution? Every single time I select \"watch live\" the app crashes. The other shows seem to work fine. What's the deal with the live stream? I've uninstalled and reinstalled - even did a factory reset several weeks ago and nothing works \"live\". That's the only reason i didn't give 5 stars. Updated 11/10/2020 Fantastic platform and getting better every day. How about that? Real news is what the people want!",
                "Yeah the app is free and you don't need a cable provider log in to access it, but what good does a free app do if when you try to read one of the articles, it redirects you to subscribe to \"Newsmax Platinum\" for $50 per year?!?! What a joke. The free app is pointless if it doesn't deliver content for free."
